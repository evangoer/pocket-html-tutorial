			<h1>Box Model: Borders</h1> 
			<p>
				The CSS <dfn>box model</dfn> is a collection of CSS properties that apply to all visual HTML elements. As <a href="#fig_boxbasic" title="Figure&nbsp;3.1.&nbsp;The Box Model">Figure 3.1, &#8220;The Box Model&#8221;</a> indicates, any HTML element, such as:
			</p>
<pre>&lt;p&gt;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
			<p>
				is nested inside three boxes:
			</p>
			<div class="figure" id="fig_boxbasic">
				<h4>Figure 3.1. The Box Model</h4>
				<p><img src="/images/html/boxbasic.png" alt="The Box Model"></p>
			</div>
			<p>
				The margin encloses the border, which encloses the padding, which encloses the content. You can use CSS to style all three of these independently.
			</p>
			<h2>Border Widths, Styles, and Colors</h2>
			<p>
				The easiest component of the box model to understand is the border, because it can be so visually striking. Most elements do not have borders by default, but they&#8217;re easy enough to add with these CSS properties:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<code>border-width</code>: A length, such as <code>3px</code> or <code>0.2em</code>. Most web designers specify their borders in pixels.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<code>border-color</code>: A color, such as <code>green</code> or <code>#ff0000</code>. The default color is usually black.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<code>border-style</code>: A keyword that indicates how to draw the border&#8217;s lines. The basic style is <code>solid</code>, but there are fancier options available, such as <code>dashed</code>, <code>dotted</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>groove</code>, <code>inset</code>, <code>outset</code>, and <code>ridge</code>. There is also a <code>none</code> option that suppresses borders. If a browsers does not support a particular &#8220;fancy&#8221; border style, it usually replaces that style with <code>solid</code>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You can apply borders to any visible element you like: divs, lists, and so on. In the following example, we create generic classes, and apply them to <code>p</code> elements.
			</p>

<pre class="html">&lt;html&gt;

  &lt;style&gt;
    .thickline {
      border-width: 10px;
      border-style: solid;
    }

    .thinblueline {
      border-width: 1px;
      border-color: #0000ff;
      border-style: solid;
    }

    .greenridge {
      border-width: 5px;
      border-color: green;
      border-style: ridge;
    }

    .empurpledash {
      border-width: 0.5em;
      border-color: #800080;
      border-style: dashed;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;p class="thickline"&gt;
    "1st, The man-mountain shall not depart from our
    dominions, without our license under our great seal.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="thinblueline"&gt;
    2d, He shall not presume to come into our metropolis,
    without our express order; at which time, the inhabitants
    shall have two hours warning to keep within doors.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="greenridge"&gt;
    3d, The said man-mountain shall confine his walks
    to our principal high roads, and not offer to walk, or
    lie down, in a meadow or field of corn.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="empurpledash"&gt;
    4th, As he walks the said roads, he shall take the
    utmost care not to trample upon the bodies of any
    of our loving subjects, their horses, or carriages, nor
    take any of our subjects into his hands without their
    own consent.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
			</div>
			<p>
				The first three borders are specifed in pixels. The last is in <code>em</code>, which means that if we change the <code>p</code>&#8217;s font size, the border thickness should scale with it.
			</p>
			<h2>Four Different Sides</h2>
			<p>
				To apply a different border to each side, you must break down <code>border-width</code>, <code>border-color</code>, and <code>border-style</code> into their constituent components:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<code>border-width</code> becomes: <code>border-top-width</code>, <code>border-bottom-width</code>, <code>border-right-width</code>, and <code>border-left-width</code>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<code>border-color</code> becomes: <code>border-top-color</code>, <code>border-bottom-color</code>, <code>border-right-color</code>, and <code>border-left-color</code>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<code>border-style</code> becomes: <code>border-top-style</code>, <code>border-bottom-style</code>, <code>border-right-style</code>, and <code>border-left-style</code>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Here&#8217;s an admittedly silly example with four different borders:
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h4>
					Example 3.17. Four Different Sides
				</h4>
				<pre class="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    p.fourborders {
      border-top-width: 5px;
      border-top-color: #ff0000;
      border-top-style: dashed;

      border-bottom-width: 10px;
      border-bottom-color: #336600;
      border-bottom-style: groove;

      border-right-width: 20px;
      border-right-color: #000080;
      border-right-style: solid;

      border-left-width: 10px;
      border-left-color: #CC9900;
      border-left-style: solid;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;p class="fourborders"&gt;
    "But I thought all witches were wicked," said the girl, who
    was half frightened at facing a real witch. "Oh, no, that is a
    great mistake. There were only four witches in all the Land of
    Oz, and two of them, those who live in the North and the South,
    are good witches. I know this is true, for I am one of them
    myself, and cannot be mistaken. Those who dwelt in the East and
    the West were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have
    killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch in all the Land
    of Oz--the one who lives in the West."
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
			</div>
			<h2>Border Shorthand Notation</h2>
			<p>
				As with the <code>font-</code> properties, there is a shorthand notation named <code>border</code>. Unlike <code>font</code>, you may specify the <code>border</code> properties in any order.
			</p>
			<p>
				Below is a version of <a href="#ex_borders2" title="Example&nbsp;3.18.&nbsp;Four Border Examples">Example 3.18, &#8220;Four Border Examples&#8221;</a>, reformulated to use the shorter notation. The properties appear in essentially random order, but the results are the same as before.

				This shorthand is convenient, but keep in mind that the <code>border</code> property can only set the same border on all four sides. Fortunately, there are yet four <em>more</em> shorthand properties that apply the border&#8217;s width, color, and style to just one side at a time: <code>border-top</code>, <code>border-right</code>, <code>border-bottom</code>, and <code>border-left</code>. For example, if you wanted to apply the green ridge border to just the left side of an element, the code:
			</p>
<pre class="html">.greenridge {
  border-left: ridge 5px green;
}</pre>
			<p>
				would do the trick.
