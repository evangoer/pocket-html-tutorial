			<h1>Images</h1> 
			<p>
				Once you understand <a href="../links/" title="Links">links</a>, adding images is straightforward.
			</p>
			<p>
				Images are a little different than the HTML headings and paragraphs that we&#8217;ve seen so far. An image is actually a separate file that you embed in your web page using the <code>img</code> element. Let&#8217;s see how this works:
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h4>
					Example 2.15. Example Image
				</h4>
<pre class="html">&lt;p&gt;
  Yet more evidence that I did not go to Art School:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/html/oscope.gif" alt="a cartoon of an oscilloscope"&gt;</pre>
			</div>
			<p>
				To try this example on your own, you not only need to copy the HTML, but you also need to download the image &#8220;oscope.gif&#8221; to your system. If you don&#8217;t know how to do this, refer to <a href="../../introduction/browser_tools/#save_images" title="Save Images">&#8220;Save Images&#8221;</a>. Save the file in the same directory as your test page, and try it out.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>img</code> element has two required attributes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						The <code>src</code> attribute provides a URL that points to the image file. If the URL is missing or incorrect, the image won&#8217;t appear. The <code>src</code> attribute is very similar to the <code>href</code> attribute of the <code>a</code> element. It&#8217;s too bad that they couldn&#8217;t both be called &#8220;href&#8221;, because then this would all be easier to remember.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The <code>alt</code> attribute provides &#8220;alternative text&#8221; for the image, should the image not be displayable. This could happen if the user turns off images in their browser, or uses a browser that doesn&#8217;t support images (such as a text-only browser or a screen reader). The alternative text could also appear while the user is waiting for the image to download, or if the link to the image is broken.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some browsers display the <code>alt</code> text as a &#8220;tooltip&#8221; that pops up if you hover your mouse over the image. Strictly speaking, this is incorrect behavior, because the <code>alt</code> attribute is for when the image cannot be displayed. To provide &#8220;extra information&#8221; about an image, use the optional <code class="attribute">title</code> attribute instead.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				An image file is not coded in the HTML language. Images have their own formats, such as GIF, JPEG, or PNG. There are several ways to acquire or create digital images:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						take a photo with a digital camera
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						use drawing software to create a digital image
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						download an image off the web using your browser&#8217;s <a href="../../introduction/browser_tools/#save_images" title="Save Images"><span class="guilabel">Save Image</span> function</a>
					</p>
					<div class="note">
						<h4>
							Note
						</h4>
						<p>
							It&#8217;s fine to mess around with images for learning purposes, but please don&#8217;t publish someone else&#8217;s images on a website unless you know you have the owner&#8217;s permission.
						</p>
					</div>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				Floating Images
			</h2>
			<p>
				Positioning elements in HTML can be tricky, and we&#8217;ll be talking about how to do this in the more advanced sections of this tutorial. That said, let&#8217;s take a sneak preview at one of the basic concepts of positioning: the <code>float</code> property.
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h4>
					Example 2.16. Floating Images
				</h4>
<pre class="html">&lt;h1&gt;Not Your Father's Oscilloscope...&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/html/oscope.gif" height="64" width="90"
alt="Right-floating oscilloscope"
style="float: right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;b&gt;Model XJ-2000&lt;/b&gt;:
Quality, quality, quality. That's what our bosses
asked for when we designed the XJ-2000, and that's
what we delivered. Our competitors claim to deliver
"quality"... but do they? Sure, they prattle on about
about sample rates, picosecond/div sweep rates,
Fast Fourier Transforms, and other technical
mumbo-jumbo. But the fact is that the XJ-2000 is
light-years ahead of the competition. From the
scratch-resistant chrome case to the innovative
green phosophorescent screen, only one word should
spring to mind when you look at the XJ-2000: quality.
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
			</div>
			<p>
				The <code>float: right</code> directive does something peculiar: it removes the image from the regular flow of the page and &#8220;floats&#8221; it to the right. The paragraph flows around the image. If we had specified <code>float: left</code>, the image would float to the left of the paragraph. (Try it!)
			</p>
			<p>
				Just like the <code>color</code> and <code>background</code> properties, you can actually apply the <code>float</code> property to nearly any element. We&#8217;ll return to this concept later.
