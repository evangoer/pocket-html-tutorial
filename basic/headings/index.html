			<h1>Headings</h1> 
			<p>
				So far we&#8217;ve covered paragraphs and line breaks&#8230; but in a long document, we probably want more structure than that. How do we create section headings?
			</p>
			<h2>The <code>h</code> Elements</h2>
			<p>
				There are six levels of heading elements: <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, <code>h4</code>, <code>h5</code>, and <code>h6</code>. These block elements tell the browser to set off the heading from the rest of the text. The <code>h1</code> heading level is the most important heading, while the <code>h6</code> level is the least important.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most browsers display headings in bold, with <code>h1</code> the largest and <code>h6</code> the smallest.
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h4>
					Example 2.6. Headings
				</h4>
<pre class="html">&lt;h1&gt;Heading 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Heading 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Heading 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Heading 4&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Heading 5&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Heading 6&lt;/h6&gt;</pre>
			</div>
			<p>
				Like the paragraph element <code>p</code>, the heading elements are block elements. Each matched set of heading elements creates a new block, automatically separated from other blocks with line breaks.
			</p>
			<h2>Mangled Headings</h2>
			<p>
				In <a href="../paragraph_breaks">&#8220;Paragraph Breaks&#8221;</a>, we discussed the consequences of failing to close your open <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;p&gt;</code> tags. This is even more important for heading elements.
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h4>
					Example 2.7. Mangled Heading and Text
				</h4>
<pre class="html">&lt;h1&gt;STAVE I: MARLEY'S GHOST

MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt
whatever about that. The register of his burial was
signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,
and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and
Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he
chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a
door-nail.</pre>
			</div>
			<p>
				Whoops! If you view the resulting web page, you'll see that the <code>h1</code> element&#8217;s oversized, bold font has spilled over onto the rest of the text. The browser has no indication where the <code>h1</code> element is supposed to end, and so it interprets the <code>h1</code> element as enclosing everything else on the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let&#8217;s fix this by closing the open <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag. We&#8217;ll put the text in its own HTML paragraph for good measure:
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h4>
					Example 2.8. Proper Heading and Text
				</h4>
<pre class="html">&lt;h1&gt;STAVE I: MARLEY'S GHOST&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt
  whatever about that. The register of his burial was
  signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,
  and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and
  Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he
  chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a
  door-nail.
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
			</div>
			<p>
				The heading and paragraph are now properly separated.
